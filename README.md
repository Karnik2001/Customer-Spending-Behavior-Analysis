# 🛍️ Customer Spending Behavior Analysis

## 📘 Overview

This project focuses on analyzing and classifying customer spending behavior using machine learning techniques. The goal is to identify spending patterns and predict customer categories, enabling data-driven decision-making for business strategies, marketing campaigns, and customer segmentation.

## 🎯 Objectives

Perform descriptive analysis to understand spending trends.

Build and evaluate multiple classification models to predict customer behavior.

Compare model performance to identify the most effective algorithm.

## 🧠 Machine Learning Models Used

The following models were implemented and compared:

XGBoost Classifier

Support Vector Classifier (SVC)

Decision Tree Classifier

Random Forest Classifier

K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)

Each model was trained on preprocessed data and evaluated using key metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

## 🧩 Key Skills and Tools

Programming Language: Python

Libraries:

pandas, numpy — Data manipulation

scikit-learn — Machine learning and evaluation

xgboost — Gradient boosting

matplotlib, seaborn — Data visualization

Techniques: Feature engineering, model training, hyperparameter tuning, and model evaluation

## 📊 Workflow Summary

Data Preprocessing – Cleaning, handling missing values, and feature scaling.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) – Visualizing trends and distributions.

Model Training & Evaluation – Implementing multiple classifiers and tuning parameters.

Performance Comparison – Selecting the most accurate model based on results.

## 🏆 Results

The comparative analysis of multiple models provided insights into the effectiveness of different algorithms for predicting customer spending categories.
(Add your model accuracy results here — e.g., “XGBoost achieved the highest accuracy of 89%.”)

## 📈 Future Improvements

Incorporate deep learning models for enhanced prediction accuracy.

Add customer segmentation using unsupervised clustering.

Deploy the model via a web dashboard or API for real-time analysis.
